# Project 0 - Nicholas Cassie

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

	My Project 0 is a 4 page website on the White Mountains.  All of the pages have a bootstrap
	navbar component for navigation.

index.html
	A simple initial page with a few paragraphs of text, an <h1> header and a picture
	of the white mountains.  The index page has an @media query that changes the h1 header
	as the screen gets smaller.

4000footer.html
	This page has a <table> listing all of the mountains in the White Mountain range that exceed 4000 feet.
	The table and its cells are formatted using scss nesting, and scss inhertiance is used to color some of the
	mountains that have ski ranges with blue font.
	
wvredliner.html
	This page has a few lines discussing the Waterville Valley Redliner Patch and lists all the trails
	that a hiker needs to complete to get that patch.  The list is a <ul> unordered list.
	
photos.html
	This page has 6 images of the White Mountains.  It uses bootstrap rows and columns to organize the photos.
	
wmstyle.scss
	This contains all of the styling for the website.

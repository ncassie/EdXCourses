# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My implementation has three files:

application.py has all of the python and flask code that handles routing and maintaining the channels.

index.html is the first page a user visits and tests whether a user has previously visited the site.
  If so, the user is welcomed by the previously used name and presented with a budget to continue to the
  channels page.
  If not, then they are asked to provide a username and provided the button to proceed to the channels.

chat.html
  This contains all of the javascript and html needed to maintain and display all of the channels and messages
  as they are emitted.

My personal touch is a private messaging feature.  It allows a user to enter another user's name and a private message
and when submitted, a javascript alert will display that message to the intended recipient only.
